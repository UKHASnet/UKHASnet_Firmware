arduino-sensor
==========

This is a low-power sensor implementation designed to be used with an ATMega168/328 and the Arduino IDE.

Sensors Supported:
* DS18B20 (Temperature)
* DHT22 (Temperature + Humidity)

This does not repeat, instead it sleeps inbetween it's own beacons to save battery power. This can run for many months off a single set of cheap AA batteries (7 months so far and counting!).

It is planned in the future to power the sensor off a switched Arduino Pin, to reduce standby current further. However this has not yet been implemented. *Phil - PCBs with this function on the way!*s


NodeConfig.h
======

Copy NodeConfig-template.h to NodeConfig.h to set up code for your nodes.

**char id[]**

This sets the ID, or callsign, of the repeater. This should be unique within the network, but as short as possible. You can see existing IDs on ukhas.net

**LOCATION_STRING**

If this is set then it will be sent as a location at boot and then every 25 packets. This sets the Lat/Long of the node on the map at ukhas.net

If you don't wish your location to be visible, comment out this line to disable it.

**BEACON_INTERVAL**

The time interval between the nodes own beacons will be a random number of seconds between (this value)x8 and (this value+10)x8

**rfm_power**

This configures the Transmit Power of the RFM69, in dBmW. eg. 1dBmW = 1mW, 10dBmW = 10mW, 17dBmW = 50mW, 20dBm = 100mW.

Note: Only the RFM69*H*W can transmit at more than 50mW.
